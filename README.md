🩺 Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques in Python 🤖. The notebook covers data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation based on medical attributes.

📊 Dataset

The dataset includes health-related features such as:

Glucose level

Blood pressure

BMI

Insulin

Age

These variables are used to predict whether a patient has diabetes.
